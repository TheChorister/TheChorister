👋 Hi, I’m [@TheChorister](https://github.com/TheChorister)
<br />
👀 I’m interested in coding (specifically web development - for now)!
<br />
🌱 I’m currently learning *many, many* things, such as React, Swift, C and web development (front end and back end).
<br />
📫 You can reach me on Scratch on [my profile](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/TheChorister)
<br />

It may look like I have no repositories, but that is mainly because all of them are private for the time being.

<!---
TheChorister/TheChorister is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
